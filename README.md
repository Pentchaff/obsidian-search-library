# 🚀 Obsidian Search Library Plugin 📚

Hello, Obsidian enthusiasts! 😄 Have you ever found yourself in this sticky situation? You've crafted the perfect search query using Obsidian's fantastic tools, found exactly what you needed, and then... you need to search for something else. And what happens? You have to retype the entire query all over again! 😫

Frustrating, isn't it? But worry no more! Introducing the **Obsidian Search Library Plugin** – designed to ease your search experience within Obsidian. Now, you can save and reuse those brilliant search operands without breaking a sweat! Say goodbye to tedious retyping and hello to a smoother, more enjoyable search experience! 🎉

## 🌟 Features

1. **Free Search**: Just type what you're looking for, and we'll find it for you. Easy as pie! 🥧
2. **Template-Enabled Search**: Want to get a bit fancy with your search? Use our templates to make your search even more powerful! 🎩
3. **Graph View Integration**: Visualize your search results in the beautiful Obsidian graph view. Connect the dots! 🌐

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Open Obsidian and go to "Settings" > "Community plugins."
2. Click on "Browse" and search for "Obsidian Search Library."
3. Click "Install" and watch the magic happen! ✨

## 📝 How to Use

### Prerequisites

- **QuickAdd Plugin**: This plugin relies on the [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) plugin to work its magic. Make sure you have it installed and set up in Obsidian before proceeding. ✅
- **Great Companion**: This plugin works wonderfully in complement with [Vantage - advanced Search Builder for Obsidian](https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/vantage-obsidian). Together, they make your Obsidian experience even more powerful! 🚀

### Assign Shortcuts

You can customize your experience by assigning shortcuts for the free search and template-enabled search:

- **Free Search**: Go to "Settings" > "Hotkeys" and set your desired shortcut for the Free Search command. A simple `Ctrl + Alt + F` might do the trick!
- **Template-Enabled Search**: Similarly, set a custom shortcut for the Template-Enabled Search command. How about `Ctrl + Alt + T`?

### Free Search

Unlock the power of visual exploration with Free Search! Use your assigned shortcut, type your query, and watch as not only the search results appear but also the Graph View pane springs to life! 🌐

That's right! You get a dual view of your search results, allowing you to see the textual information and a visual representation of how it all connects within your notes. It's like having a bird's-eye view of your knowledge, all at your fingertips. Explore, discover, and enjoy the interconnected beauty of your thoughts and ideas! 🎨

### Template-Enabled Search

Leverage the power of templates to refine your search. The best part? The templates work with the same syntax as QuickAdd ([reference here](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/FormatSyntax)), so you already know how to use them! 🎩

Unlock the potential of templates in your search! With Template-Enabled Search, you can create and use custom templates to refine your search queries. Here's how:

#### Creating Templates 📝

1. **Set Up a Templates Folder**: Choose a folder within Obsidian where you'll store your search templates.
2. **Create New Templates**: Simply create new notes in the templates folder, using the template format syntax. Think of these templates as your secret search weapons!
4. **Enjoy Flexibility**: Want to make a change? Just edit the template note, and it's instantly updated in your searches.

>[!note] Simple Search Template example
>Search in Folder
>path:folderA/{{value}}

>[!note] Template example using QuickAdd syntax
>TITLE
> (path:{{value:project}})  AND (file: transcript) {{value:query}}

#### Using Templates 🔍

1. **Assign a Shortcut**: Go to "Settings" > "Hotkeys" and set a custom shortcut for the Template-Enabled Search command.
2. **Use the Shortcut**: Whenever you want to search with a template, use the assigned shortcut.
3. **Select a Template**: You'll see a list of your templates. Choose the one you want, and voila! Your search is refined and tailored to your needs.

Templates bring precision, efficiency, and creativity to your search experience. Have fun experimenting with different templates and discovering new insights! 🧩
